# 🔐 **Password Strength Analyzer with AI**

## 📌 **Description**
Weak passwords remain a leading cause of data breaches. Traditional strength meters fail to assess real-world attack scenarios, making systems vulnerable to brute-force attacks, dictionary-based guessing, and credential stuffing. Our **AI-Powered Password Strength Analyzer** leverages **Vector Databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate)** and **AI-driven analysis (LLaMA, GPT)** to provide advanced security, real-time password evaluation, and proactive risk mitigation.
