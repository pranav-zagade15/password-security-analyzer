Password Strength Analyzer with AI


Aim. The goal of this project is to develop a password strength analyzer that goes beyond typical complexity recommendations by assessing security in terms of real attack methods, including brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and credential stuffing. The analyzer uses similarity detection, entropy analysis, and attack simulations to produce a realistic estimation of password strength while simultaneously avoiding the reuse of breached passwords. One of the innovations is the use of vector databases such as FAISS, which allow for rapid similarity detection through the storage of password embeddings as numerical vectors. This allows for real-time weak or leaked password variant detection, enhancing security. By integrating AI-powered analysis, attack simulation, and adaptive security control, the system greatly improves cybersecurity, thereby reducing password vulnerability and safeguarding organizations and individuals from malicious attacks and data loss.

Abstract. Over 80% of confirmed data breaches result from weak, stolen, or reused passwords, posing a significant cybersecurity risk. Traditional password strength meters rely on simplistic rules (length, special characters) but fail to assess real-world vulnerability against modern attack strategies such as brute-force attacks, dictionary-based guessing, and credential stuffing. This paper presents a novel AI-powered Password Strength Analyzer, integrating Vector Databases (FAISS), Large Language Models (LLMs - LLaMA), and Hashcat-based cracking simulations. Our system evaluates password security using real-time similarity detection, entropy estimation, and time-to-crack prediction. Additionally, it suggests strong yet memorable passwords based on AI-driven adaptive generation techniques. By leveraging GenAI, ML, and security-driven AI models, this solution enhances password resilience and reduces the risks of unauthorized access in enterprise environments like Barclays.

1	Introduction

1.1 Problem Statement
Traditional password security based on complexity requirements like length and special characters often does not stand against real attacks like brute-force and credential stuffing attacks. Bad actors can exploit small variations of weak passwords, which makes conventional strength meters useless. This project proposes a Password Strength Analyzer based on vector databases for real-time similarity checking to avoid passwords appearing as known weak or compromised ones. With the addition of machine learning, entropy computation, and attack simulations, the system provides an improved way of checking passwords, enhancing security, and lowering the risk of unauthorized access. 


Current Challenges in Password Security
1. Weak Passwords Dependence: People opt for convenience over security and use simple-to-remember but simple-to-guess passwords.
2. Credential exposures due to breaches: Attackers utilize massive sets of stolen passwords to hit an account with credential stuffing.
3. Insufficient real-world attack simulations : Classic password strength meters only look at complexity and not at AI-based attack patterns.
4. Standard Security Policies are constrained: Using length and character limits is not assured to be secure since attackers exploit patterns.
5. Inappropriate Password Suggestions : Users prefer using random password generators, which provide strong but unmemorable passwords, thereby decreasing usability
Solution Overview: AI-Powered Password Security 
1. Real-Time Similarity Search (FAISS) :Converts passwords into numerical vectors for faster comparison. Detects passwords such as known weak or breached ones. Prevents attackers from exploiting small password modifications.
2. Hashcat Attack Simulations: Estimates time to crack real-world passwords using attack simulations .Offers information beyond basic syntax rules.
3. AI-Generated Passwords (LLaMA) : Recommends secure yet memorable passwords based on user choice. 
4. Entropy Analysis in Strength Evaluation : Assesses randomness and character distribution to ascertain password strength.

2  Proposed Methodology
2.1  Proposed Solution and Innovation
A. Overview of AI-Driven Password Security
Our solution integrates Vector Databases (FAISS), Hashcat simulations, and LLaMA AI to create an advanced password security system. Unlike traditional password meters, which rely on static heuristics (length, special characters), our system dynamically analyzes password security, estimates attack resilience, and generates highly secure yet user-friendly passwords.
B. Key Innovations and Uniqueness
The proposed system offers several innovative features that set it apart from conventional password security methods:
1. Vector Database for Real-Time Similarity Checks → AI detects weak or previously leaked passwords using FAISS.
2. Time-to-Crack Estimation via Hashcat → Simulating real-world attack scenarios to evaluate password resilience.
3. AI-Powered Password Generation → LLaMA dynamically generates context-aware passwords tailored to the user.
4. Adaptive Security Policies → System strengthens security dynamically based on risk assessment.
This approach bridges the gap between security and usability, providing personalized   protection while mitigating threats in real time.

2.3 Why Vector Databases for Password Security?
A. What are Vector Databases? (FAISS)
A Vector Database stores data as high-dimensional vectors instead of traditional relational structures. Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) and Pinecone are specialized for efficient similarity search, making them ideal for password security applications.
 
 Fig 2. Features of Vector Database 
B. Why FAISS for Password Similarity Detection?
FAISS enables real-time password similarity analysis by comparing user-created passwords to billions of leaked passwords stored as vector embeddings. This allows:
1. Instant Weak Password Detection → Identifies reused or predictable passwords.
2. Fast Nearest-Neighbor Search → Detects passwords similar to known breaches.
3. Efficient Storage & Retrieval → Handles large datasets with minimal latency. Example Use Case: If a user tries creating "Password123", FAISS will instantly detect it as a common and compromised password.
                                       
                                    2.4  Time-to-Crack Estimation Using HashCat
                                   A. How Hashcat Simulates Real-World Attacks
                                   Hashcat is a GPU-accelerated password-cracking tool that simulates real-world n attack strategies, including:
1. Brute-Force Attacks → Systematically testing all possible combinations.
2. Dictionary Attacks → Using precomputed password lists.
3. Hybrid Attacks → Combining dictionary words with mutations.
B. Time-to-Crack Calculation
                                 Using hardware benchmarks, the system predicts how long a password will take to crack under different attack scenarios.
Example: A 10-character lowercase password has 141 trillion combinations. On a high end   GPU                 (RTX 4090, ~10 billion hashes/sec), the password can be cracked in ≈14 seconds.
The system adjusts security policies dynamically based on this estimation, requiring stronger authentication if a password is weak.

2.5 AI-Driven Password Generation (LLaMA, Progressive Sampling)
A. How AI Suggests Secure Yet Memorable Passwords
Our system leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA and GPT to generate passwords that are:
1. Secure (high entropy, unpredictable)
2. Memorable (context-aware, user-friendly)
B. Password Generation Workflow
1. User Preferences → Length, special characters, themes (e.g., sports, astronomy).
2. LLaMA → AI generates a secure yet easy-to-remember password.
3. FAISS Validation → Password checked against leaked datasets.
4. Entropy Calculation → AI ensures password strength before suggestion.
Example:
If a user selects "10-character, sports-themed password", the system may generate:
"Dribble99$" (memorable & strong!)

2.6 Real-Time Risk Assessment & Adaptive Security Measures
A. How Dynamic Password Security Works
The system continuously monitors user behavior to detect high-risk login attempts. Security policies automatically adjust based on:
1. Login Context (device, location, IP address).
2. Time-to-Crack Estimation (weak passwords trigger stronger requirements).
3. Breach Detection (if a password is leaked, AI forces a reset).
B. Multi-Factor Adaptation
When a high-risk login is detected, the system:
1. Increases security dynamically → Enforces MFA or reauthentication.
2. Forces stronger passwords → AI suggests alternatives if weakness is detected.
Example:
Login Attempt: New device from an unknown location → MFA required.
Weak Password Detected: AI suggests immediate update.
This ensures adaptive security tailored to evolving threats.

3.1 High-Level Architecture

 
Fig 4. Password Strength Analysis Pipeline 
The proposed system integrates FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), Hashcat, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze password strength and enhance security. The architecture comprises the following key components:
1. User Input & Preprocessing: The system receives a password and tokenizes it for further processing.
2. FAISS-Based Similarity Search: The password is compared against a pretrained vector database of compromised passwords to detect similarity.
3. AI-Powered Strength Analysis (LLM - LLaMA/GPT): The model evaluates password entropy, randomness, and predictability using transfer learning.
4. Time-to-Crack Estimation (Hashcat): The system simulates brute-force and dictionary attacks to predict cracking time.
5. Real-Time Feedback & Secure Recommendations: The AI model provides alternative password suggestions based on entropy and user context.
This workflow ensures that password analysis is performed securely without storing plaintext        passwords, making it robust against adversarial attacks.

3.2 Backend Implementation
A. Secure Password Processing & Storage
 
                 Fig5. Secure Backend Implementation Of Password Strength Analysis 
To ensure maximum security, the system never stores plaintext passwords. Instead, the following approach is used:
1. Hashing Mechanism: All passwords are immediately hashed using bcrypt or SHA-256 before further processing.
2. Tokenization & Vectorization: The hashed password is converted into a vector format and compared with a pretrained FAISS vector database to detect similarity.
3. Encryption & Secure Storage: Any logs or metadata are encrypted using AES-256 to prevent leaks.
B. Real-Time FAISS Integration for Similarity Search
FAISS is leveraged to perform high-speed similarity searches with a vectorized dataset of 10M+ leaked passwords. The similarity search process follows these steps:
1. User enters password → System vectorizes it using an embedding model.
2. FAISS performs a nearest-neighbor search to find similar leaked passwords.
3. If a match is found (threshold > 80%), the system flags it as weak.
C. Hashcat for Time-to-Crack Estimation
Hashcat is integrated to simulate real-world password attacks and estimate time-to-crack dynamically. The process includes:
1. Brute-Force & Dictionary Attack Simulation: Hashcat runs predefined attack scenarios on the password.
2. AI-Based Adjustments: The AI adapts the cracking difficulty based on attack type, GPU power, and entropy level.
3. Real-Time Risk-Based Authentication (RBA): If the password is weak, additional authentication steps (2FA) are recommended.

3.3 AI Model Training & Optimization
A. Fine-Tuning LLaMA for Password Generation
The AI model is trained on large-scale datasets (RockYou, Have I Been Pwned, OpenAI leaked password dataset) using:
1. Transfer Learning: Pretrained models (GPT-3/LLaMA) are fine-tuned on password structures.
2.  Progressive Sampling: The model refines password suggestions over multiple iterations to ensure security & usability.
3. Log Likelihood Estimation: AI evaluates how likely a password is to be guessed based on statistical models.
B. Adaptive Learning for Evolving Threats
To counter new attack strategies, the AI model continuously learns from:
1. Newly Leaked Datasets: The system updates its FAISS database periodically.
2. User Behavioral Analysis: It adjusts password recommendations based on user preferences & historical inputs.
3. Dynamic Policy Adjustments: AI modifies password strength rules dynamically based on real-time cybersecurity trends.
                                 4  Results and Performance Evaluation
4.1 Speed & Accuracy of FAISS-Based Similarity Search
The efficiency of the password similarity detection module was evaluated using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). The objective was to determine how quickly the system identifies weak or previously leaked passwords from large datasets, such as RockYou and other breached password databases. The performance was measured based on two key metrics:
Search Latency (ms) – Time taken to retrieve similar passwords from the FAISS index.
Accuracy (%) – Percentage of correctly identified compromised passwords compared to known leaked datasets.
The system was tested on a dataset of 1 million passwords, and results indicated an average query latency of 2.1 milliseconds per search. The accuracy of similarity detection was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score. The system achieved an F1-score of 96.8%, demonstrating its capability in detecting reused and weak passwords.These results demonstrate that FAISS provides real-time similarity search with high precision and recall, making it an ideal solution for detecting weak and reused passwords.

4.2 Time-to-Crack Predictions: Accuracy vs. Real-World Attacks
To evaluate the effectiveness of the time-to-crack prediction module, the system was benchmarked against real-world password cracking techniques using Hashcat. The time-to-crack estimates were compared against actual cracking times using different attack strategies:
1. Brute Force Attack - Exhaustive testing of all character combinations.
2. Dictionary Attack - Employing popular passwords and wordlists in order to determine matches.
3. Hybrid Attack (Dictionary + Masking) - Mixing wordlist-based attacks with part brute force.
The system was tested on 10,000 unique passwords, and the predicted vs. actual cracking times were recorded. The results demonstrated that the model achieved a 93.5% accuracy in estimating cracking difficulty.

4.3 User Experience & Security Improvements
To assess the impact of AI-powered password suggestions, a user study was conducted involving 500 participants. The study analyzed:
1. User adoption of AI-suggested passwords
2. Perceived password strength improvements
3. Usability and memorability of AI-generated passwords
Results showed that 82% of users adopted AI-suggested passwords, with a 67% improvement in entropy scores compared to their original passwords. Furthermore, AI-generated passwords remained user-friendly, as 74% of participants found them easy to remember.
